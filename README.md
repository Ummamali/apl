### RCS-1 Repository

This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed for the course “Advanced Programming Languages.” It serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding advanced programming concepts through practical, well-structured examples.

While the primary focus is on Java, the principles demonstrated here are widely applicable across other programming languages such as C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, Kotlin, and Swift. Each example is designed to highlight fundamental and advanced features like object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, multithreading, exception handling, file management, and design patterns.

The repository aims to provide both students and developers with a clear, hands-on understanding of how these concepts can be implemented efficiently and cleanly in real-world applications. Every piece of code is written with clarity, readability, and scalability in mind, making it suitable for learners, educators, and anyone looking to strengthen their grasp of modern programming practices.

Whether you are revising for a course, preparing for interviews, or exploring programming paradigms beyond Java, this repository offers a solid foundation and practical insights into advanced coding techniques.

## 🧩 Basics

- Primitive & Reference Data Types
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Looping Constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Traditional `switch` Statement
- Modern `switch` Expression (Java 14+)
- User Input Handling (`Scanner`, etc.)
- Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Overflow, Truncation, Floating-point Imprecision
- Implicit and Explicit Casting

## 📊 Arrays

- Array Declaration & Initialization
- Array Indexing & Access
- Implementing Dynamic Sequences from Static Arrays
- Linear Search Algorithm
- Binary Search Algorithm
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

Here's the markdown code for the matrices section:
